# DealzHunter


This project serves the purpose of searching the current market for certain things. 
It looks at the **NON-AVAILABILITY** of the items and monitors them. 
If one of the items is available, a mail is sent automatically, as well as a Discord message via a WebHook in a Discord channel.

This project is based on the services Google provides to each of its users *(Spreadsheet and Google Apps Script [JavaScript])* and can only be used there so far. 

A replacement and extension in TypeScript as a back-end application is currently in planning/implementation! 



Feel free to contact @MeineQuest with any questions or suggestions!
